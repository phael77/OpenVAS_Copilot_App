  form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publicly accessible open
  recursive DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response traffic.

  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request to an open
  recursive DNS server with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. When the DNS
  server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead to the victim. Attackers will typically
  submit a request for as much zone information as possible to maximize the amplification effect.
  Because the size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker
  is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim. By leveraging a botnet to perform
  additional spoofed DNS queries, an attacker can produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with
  little effort. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from valid servers,
  it is especially difficult to block these types of attacks.

  - trust all clients which can reach the server

  - do not allow recursive queries from outside your trusted client network","Sends a crafted UDP based DNS request and checks the response.

  form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publicly accessible open
  recursive DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response traffic.

  The basic attack technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request to an open
  recursive DNS server with the source address spoofed to be the victim's address. When the DNS
  server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead to the victim. Attackers will typically
  submit a request for as much zone information as possible to maximize the amplification effect.
  Because the size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request, the attacker
  is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim. By leveraging a botnet to perform
  additional spoofed DNS queries, an attacker can produce an overwhelming amount of traffic with
  little effort. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from valid servers,
  it is especially difficult to block these types of attacks.

  Note: This finding might be an acceptable risk if you:

  - trust all clients which can reach the server

  - do not allow recursive queries from outside your trusted client network","Sends a crafted UDP based DNS request and checks the response.

  - The 'none' algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done. Note that this method provides
  no confidentiality protection, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.

  - A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an attacker to
  recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.","Checks the supported encryption algorithms (client-to-server
  and server-to-client) of the remote SSH server.

  Currently weak encryption algorithms are defined as the following:

  - Arcfour (RC4) cipher based algorithms

  - 'none' algorithm

  - CBC mode cipher based algorithms

  no confidentiality protection, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.

  If you think any of this information is wrong please report it to the referenced community

Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.

This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.

This service seems to be able to host ASP scripts.

The User-Agent ""Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 23.4.1)"" was used to access the remote host.

Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for CGI scanning. You can enable this again with the ""Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

The following directories were used for CGI scanning:

http://oxala.speed.dcc.ufmg.br:8775/

While this is not, in and of itself, a bug, you should manually inspect these directories to ensure that they are in compliance with company security standards

  - it is [mis]configured in that it does not return '404 Not Found' error codes when a non-existent
  file is requested, perhaps returning a site map, search page, authentication page or redirect instead.

  The Scanner might enabled some counter measures for that, however they might be insufficient. If a
  great number of security issues are reported for this port, they might not all be accurate.

  - it doesn't response in a reasonable amount of time to various HTTP requests sent by this VT.

  In order to keep the scan total time to a reasonable amount, the remote web server might not be
  tested. If the remote server should be tested it has to be fixed to have it reply to the scanners
  requests in a reasonable amount of time.

  If you think any of this information is wrong please report it to the referenced community
  forum.","The Hostname/IP ""bigsea-01.speed.dcc.ufmg.br"" was used to access the remote host.

Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1.

This service seems to be able to host PHP scripts.

This service seems to be NOT able to host ASP scripts.

The User-Agent ""Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 23.4.1)"" was used to access the remote host.

Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for CGI scanning. You can enable this again with the ""Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin to directories for CGI scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

The following directories were used for CGI scanning:

http://bigsea-01.speed.dcc.ufmg.br/
http://bigsea-01.speed.dcc.ufmg.br/ases
http://bigsea-01.speed.dcc.ufmg.br/assets

While this is not, in and of itself, a bug, you should manually inspect these directories to ensure that they are in compliance with company security standards

The following directories were excluded from CGI scanning because the ""Regex pattern to exclude directories from CGI scanning"" setting of the VT ""Global variable settings"" (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.12288) for this scan was: ""/(index\.php|image|img|css|js$|js/|javascript|style|theme|icon|jquery|graphic|grafik|picture|bilder|thumbnail|media/|skins?/)""

The ""Number of pages to mirror"" setting (Current: 200) of the VT ""Web mirroring"" (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10662) was reached. Raising this limit allows to mirror this host more thoroughly but might increase the scanning time.
